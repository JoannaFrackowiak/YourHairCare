# YourHairCare
<!---
This is my first Web application. I did't use Git when I created it.

The app allows:

- register/login users,
- add cosmetics to DB,
- create two types list (shopping and user's cosmetics),
- search cosmetics (cosmetic's page include short description about it).

In future I want to add possibility create daily care.

I used Spring Boot, Hibernate, HTML and Bootstrap but application is not finished yet.
